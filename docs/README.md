# FUTURE_ML_01 – AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## 📌 About the Task
This project is part of my **Future Interns Machine Learning Internship** (Task 1).  
The goal is to build an **AI-powered sales forecasting system** that predicts future sales trends using machine learning, and present the insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and structure historical retail sales data.
- Engineer features such as monthly sales and seasonal patterns.
- Train a **time series forecasting model** using **Facebook Prophet**.
- Build a Power BI dashboard for visualization.
- Provide clear **business insights** from the results.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Superstore Sales Dataset**
- **GitHub** for code hosting

---

## 📊 Key Features in Dashboard
✔ Sales trend line with **actual vs forecasted** data  
✔ **Monthly & yearly comparisons**  
✔ Filters by **Category** and **Region**  
✔ Highlighted **top-selling items** and low seasons  
✔ KPI cards for quick decision-making (Total Sales, Total Profit, Avg. Discount)

## 📈 Model Performance
- **MAE**  : 5665.18  
- **RMSE** : 7260.16  
- **MAPE** : 13.22%  
- **sMAPE**: 13.16%  

The model provides a reliable monthly sales forecast for decision-making.
